15204365-13_10414734-13	In premenarcheal girls, bone is partly determined by mass, with lean mass the most important predictor at the femoral sites.	Sensitivity of enhanced images was 85% (specificity 80%) compared with 38% for unenhanced images (specificity 80%) and 77% for conventional gray-scale TRUS (specificity 60%).	1
17943778-25_9221411-14	This translates into a one year NNT ranging from 10 (6 to 35) for patients with a 51% risk of exacerbation, to an NNT of 24 (16 to 80) for patients with a 13% risk of exacerbation.	In conclusion, our results indicate that a yearly mammography is mandatory in long-term HRT subjects and US may be also needed in particularly dense breasts.	1
8726199-24_16010446-7	Literature review documents a surprising paucity of quality studies examining variables predictive of this important socioeconomic outcome variable.	There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of mean age and lumbar BMD (p = 0.009 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).	1
15318285-11_2562385-6	19 patients in the CYR group (95%) and 13 patients in the PT group (65%) reached sufficient ROM at the end of the second week (p &lt;0.05).	Eicosapentaenoic acid inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis and chemiluminescence in vitro.	1
15893192-11_8752484-5	Mean age was 50 years, and average intake of total linolenic acid was 0.74 g/day.	These data suggest that diagnostic criteria should not be based on apnea index or desaturation alone.	1
14671048-15_6648007-5	Control leptin levels demonstrated correlation with fullness scores (e.g. peak fullness, r = 0.45, P = 0.007) but the dialysis patients did not.	Patients experiencing satisfactory results may expect significant relief from a second infusion for recurrent pain.	1
12137645-25_15899921-15	While desmopressin was better than diclofenac or indomethacin, and comparison with tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline and imipramine) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, the data were inconclusive due to small numbers.	The small advantage shown at 2 years of age is no longer detectable at 5 years.	1
14966719-15_14966719-16	The final prognostic model for the 8-week DASH scores included the baseline score (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.66), sex (female) (95% CI, 3.3-14.5), and self-reported nerve symptoms (95% CI, 0.8-13.8).	The model for the 8-week VAS scores included the baseline score (95% CI, 0.01-0.37), sex (female) (95% CI, 0.4-18.2), and self-reported nerve symptoms (95% CI, 4.7-25.5).	3
10362442-12_16872507-16	Nefazodone and bupropion were each found to be more effective than placebo in studies of severe depression.	The major journals accessed were Journal of Emergency Nursing(37.5%), American Journal of Medicine(30.0%) and JAMA(27.5%).	1
7457512-10_9091340-13	This investigation further substantiates the increased fetal and neonatal risks associated with a nonreactive NST and a positive CST.	The patients with hydrosalpinx had greater numbers of oocytes retrieved per cycle (15.0 versus 11.6) and embryos transferred per cycle then those without hydrosalpinges (4.21 versus 3.98).	1
10577398-19_9403018-15	Combining the beta-hCG rate of change with the ultrasound result identified 3 high-risk groups: patients with beta-hCG values that increased by less than 66% and an empty uterus at ultrasound (OR 24.8); patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by less	Eight patients in group III had a 66% response.	1
15994574-14_9392045-9	CRTs may prevent some admissions and patients prefer them, although other outcomes appear unchanged in the short term.	The average importance weights assigned by the SCI group differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from those assigned by the general population on several dimensions.	1
16327580-10_16327580-11	First-degree relatives of GR subjects were at significantly higher risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder than the relatives of PR subjects (p&lt;.05).	Second-degree relatives of the GR were at significantly higher risk of antisocial personality disorder compared to the relatives of PR subjects (p&lt;.05).	3
