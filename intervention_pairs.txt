11689979-10_18231889-11	A course of 15 acupuncture treatments was administered over a 7(1/2)-week period.	Participants were randomly assigned to standard treatment plus acupuncture (n=125), standard treatment plus specific stabilising exercises (n=131) or to standard treatment alone (n=130).	2.2
8864710-2_9289524-5	Forty-seven patients were treated with ACV at a dose of 4 g/day in 5 doses for at least a week; the others did not undergo any kind of treatment.	The procedure to incorporate in both groups included physical exam, a blood test and the MALT questionnaire.	1.2
11319657-8_3628166-3	Fibrinogen, factor VII coagulant activity, von Willebrand factor antigen, and soluble P-selectin were determined before and after a 3 week programme including energy restriction and physical activities.	Following learning, chicks were exposed at each temperature to air speeds of 0, .5, 1.0, and 1.5 m/s according to a Latin-square design.	1
12875916-4_6263533-3	Orexin-A was administered intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly 7 days after a partial sciatic nerve injury.	Treatment was started with DS 103-282 at a mean dosage of 7.4 mg. per day which was adjusted according to response up to 14.5 mg. per day at the end of the 8-week trial period.	1
18640876-9_15725222-3	Nine human three-vertebra segments (T12-L2) were prepared and a compression fracture was generated in the superior vertebrae.	The stimulus consisted of a series of five stimuli (frequency: 3 Hz) delivered randomly at 10 different sites on the sole of the foot.	1.2
11581542-5_11581542-7	Peak torque was measured on two occasions separated by approximately 7 d at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 degrees.s(-1) with 2 min of recovery between each bout.	Subjects then performed three bouts of 30 flexions and extensions of the dominant leg at 180 degrees.s(-1) with 1 min of recovery between bouts.	1.6
17030685-8_8630199-7	CHF was induced by ventricular tachypacing (220 bpm for 3 weeks), and oral PFD was administered for the 3-week pacing period.	A 1-wk washout period was followed by a 4-wk drug trial of either mexiletine (450 mg/day) or placebo.	1
17582499-4_9747834-4	They also received pre- and postnatal exposure to one of two diets, both based on the AIN-93 semipurified formulation.	Patient self-assessment by using pain chart enabled evaluation of response to treatment that consisted of either one of the three single fractions of 4 Gy (group I; n=109), 6 Gy (group II; n=108), or 8 Gy (group III; n=110).	1
12465733-8_18258231-10	Animals in group A (n = 6) were subjected to 30 min of PD obstruction and 60 min of PD decompression.	Collection of peripheral and umbilical cord blood samples.	1
11959045-10_14770136-7	All patients received conventional treatment with digoxin, diuretic agents and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.	The model consists of a pyramidal series of eight specific rehabilitation exercises in the following sequence: passive protected extension, place and hold, active composite fist, hook and straight fist, isolated joint motion, resistive composite fist, res	1
8562664-4_8864710-3	The first part of the study included placebo and clomipramine infusions and monitoring of OC symptoms by 100 mm Visual Analogue self-rated scales (VAS).	Electrodiagnostic examination of the nerves and muscles corresponding to the dermatomeric lesions was performed, including sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, blink reflex and electromyography (EMG).	1.2
11319657-8_18458990-5	Fibrinogen, factor VII coagulant activity, von Willebrand factor antigen, and soluble P-selectin were determined before and after a 3 week programme including energy restriction and physical activities.
