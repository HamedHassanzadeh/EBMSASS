Biomedical Scientific Artefacts Semantic Similarity Quantification

Each file contains pairs of scientific artefacts (sentences) and the ground truth semantic similarity scores. The format of the data is as followings:

pair_id \t sentence1 \t sentence2 \t similarity score

Similarity scores are in the range of 1 (low similarity) to 5 (high similarity).
